You’re running your tests, and there it is again — a red light, a failing check, a bug. You sigh, roll your eyes, and maybe mutter something about “the devs.” But what if I told you... the bug isn’t the problem?

In fact, that little bug might be your system’s most honest state. And the truth is, it’s not the bug’s fault — it’s yours.

Inspired by the always-lively BugBash2025 test conference, this post is a lighthearted, philosophical, and (hopefully) enlightening take on why bugs deserve a little more love — or at least, a little less blame.

## The universe of software states

Every software system — no matter how simple or complex — can be described as a collection of possible **states**. A state is just a snapshot of your system at a given moment: values of variables, inputs, outputs, internal flags, you name it.

Here’s the kicker: the system doesn’t “know” which states are good or bad. It just *is*. The universe allows every combination, and it’s up to *you*, the designer, to say which ones are valid, desirable, and expected.

Let’s take a ridiculously simple example:

    def add(a, b):
        return a + b

Now imagine these two states:

- `[a=1, b=1, result=2]` ✅  
- `[a=1, b=1, result=3]` ❌  

Both are perfectly valid *from the universe’s perspective* — but only one matches our *definition* of what addition means. The second state is a “bug” only because **we** decided that `1 + 1` must equal `2`.

And that’s the whole point. A “bug” is just an **undesirable state**. It’s not evil. It’s not malicious. It’s just... there.

## “Bug or feature?” – Perspective matters

Every tester or developer has faced the eternal question:  
> _“Is this a bug... or a feature?”_

And the truth is, the difference often lies in **perspective**.

Sometimes, a “bug” gets discovered and users actually *like* it. Or your team realizes that the “unexpected” behavior solves a real-world problem — and suddenly it’s promoted to “undocumented feature” status.

That’s because there’s nothing inherently wrong with a bug state. It’s just not aligned with someone’s expectations — which may themselves be shifting or incomplete.

In other words, bugs are just **states we didn’t plan for** — and sometimes, not planning for something is the real bug.

## Why bugs happen: the problem of state explosion

As systems grow in complexity, the number of possible states grows **exponentially**. This is the well-known problem of **state explosion**.

You may only think in terms of a few inputs or edge cases, but your system doesn’t care — it’s capable of reaching **millions** (or more!) combinations of internal and external conditions.

Since we can’t test every possible state, undesirable ones sneak in — and surprise! They often get labeled as bugs.

But the truth is, the system is just exploring the space you built for it. You gave it the keys, and it took a wrong turn... because you forgot to build a roadblock.

## What can we do? — Design with state in mind

We can’t eliminate bugs entirely, but we *can* improve how we deal with them — and even reduce how often they show up — by designing with **state** in mind.

### ✅ Tip #1: Limit the state space

Be ruthless. Avoid adding options, flags, or configurations unless they’re truly needed. Every additional branch or case increases the number of possible states exponentially.

### ✅ Tip #2: Define what “valid” means

Don’t just rely on intuition. If you can, **formally define** the valid state space. Whether it’s contracts, assertions, or state models — write it down.

### ✅ Tip #3: Test behaviors, not just results

Focus on how the system behaves in response to events and inputs over time. A snapshot might pass, but the **path** could still be wrong.

### ✅ Tip #4: Use model-based or property-based testing

These testing approaches are great at **exploring unexpected states** and helping you find issues in places your brain forgot to look.

### ✅ Tip #5: Treat bugs as insights

Every bug is a clue about your system’s structure. Ask: “What path led here?” and “How can we prevent it — or learn from it?”

## A new attitude towards bugs

So let’s stop bashing bugs.  
Let’s stop treating them like invaders or villains.

Bugs are **natural consequences** of systems we build. They’re not lies — they’re inconvenient truths.

A bug is your system telling you, “Hey, I can do this too — did you think about that?”

Instead of blame, let’s bring **curiosity**. Instead of punishment, let’s pursue **understanding**. And instead of fear, let’s aim for **better design**.

## Conclusion: Embrace your bugs

Next time you find a bug, don’t reach for your hammer — reach for your model.  
Try asking:

> “What state did I forget to consider?”  
> “Is this really a mistake, or just a path I didn’t anticipate?”  
> “What can I learn from this bug?”

And remember — bugs don’t happen *to* you.  
They happen *because* of you.  
And that means... you’re in control.

## Bonus: Explore behaviors with TestFlows

If you’re interested in testing behavior models or exploring equivalence classes, check out [TestFlows](https://testflows.com). It’s a Python testing framework designed to help you model, define, and explore complex systems in a structured way — so you can prevent bugs by understanding your system better.

Because the fewer undesirable states your system has... the fewer bugs you’ll meet.
